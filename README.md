Firebase Train Scheduler**

**Overview**
In this assignment, the objective was to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulates the data with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

**Requirements**
-App must suit these basic specs:
-When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
-Train Name
-Destination
-First Train Time -- in military time
-Frequency -- in minutes
-Calculate when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.
-Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
-Added Functionality
-Form Validation for correct time input
